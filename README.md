## IIM B - Swayam Course

Decision makers often struggle with questions such as: <br/> What should be the right price for a product? Which customer is likely to default in his/her loan repayment? <br/> Which products should be recommended to an existing customer? <br/> Finding right answers to these questions can be challenging yet rewarding.

**Predictive analytics** is emerging as a competitive strategy across many business sectors and can set apart high performing companies. It aims to predict the probability of the occurrence of a future event such as customer churn, loan defaults, and stock market fluctuations â€“ leading to effective business management.

**Models** such as multiple linear regression, logistic regression, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), decision trees, and neural networks are frequently used in solving predictive analytics problems. 

### Week1: Introduction to Analytics
**Analytics** is a body of knowledge consisting of statistical, mathematical, and operations research techniques;<br/>artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning and deep learning algorithms; data collection and storage; <br/>data management processes such as data extraction, transformation and loading (ETL);<br/> And computing and big data technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, and Hive that create value by developing actionable items from data. The primary macro-level objectives of analytics are problem solving and decision making.

**Need** 

flipkart
- forcast demand for each SKU
- Predict customer cancellations and returns
- Predict customer contacts at the customer service
- Predict what a customer is likely to purchase in future.
- how to optimize the delivery system  ----> Prescriptive analytics

- making smart basket based on prior orders

The [**different components** ](https://youtu.be/7q1kCXvcqXg)of analytics.
1. **Descriptive Analytics** focus on what happened in the past.
2. **Predictive Analytics** focus on what will happen in the future.
3. **Prescriptive Analytics** focus on what action to take.

#### Predictive Analytics - widely used across several industries
It aims to predict the probability of occurrence of a future event such as forecasting demand for products/services, customer churn, employee attrition, loan defaults, fraudulent transactions, insurance claim, and stock market fluctuations.

Objectives here:

* Framework for predictive analytics model development and deployment.
* Problems that companies try to solve using predictive analytics.
* Different classification of algorithms used in Machine Learning.

[Regression](https://youtu.be/pSuqNYpY1KA): One of the supervised learning algorithms.
A **regression model** requires the knowledge of both the dependent and the independent variables in the training data set. 

Importance:
1. Finance -  Capital Asset Pricing Model, non-performing assets, probability of default, chance of bankruptcy, and credit risk.
2. Marketing - sales,  market share, customer satisfaction, customer churn, customer retention, and customer life time value, how to improve success probability of a new product, what is the impact of food label on purchase decision, which promotion is more effective
3. Operations -  inventory requirement, productivity, and efficiency
4. HR - job satisfaction and attrition

[Types](https://youtu.be/acuRfxYqMno):
1. Simple Regression
2. Multiple Regression

each can be subdivided to Linear and NonLinear

### Week2: Simple Linear Regression 
Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical model in which there is only one independent variable and the functional relationship between the dependent variable and the regression coefficient is linear.
